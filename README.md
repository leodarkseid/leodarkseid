### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Leo! I've had a few different career paths - from saving lives as a Medic to building them as a business development manager, and now, coding my way to a better future as a full stack developer. But one thing's remained constant: my mission to leave the world a better place than I found it. And who knows, maybe with your help, we can change the world one line of code at a time.

I strongly feel "The Office" is the best thing that ever graced Television.

I am huge fan of Football, also very passionate about Barcelona Fc  ðŸ˜Ž
