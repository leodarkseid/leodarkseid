### Hi there 👋
I'm Leo! 


I am a Versatile Software Engineer skilled and experienced in building robust Backend infrastructures, developing Smart Contracts, and creating intuitive frontend systems and research.
I have played pivotal roles in building protocols and applications that process millions of dollars worth of assets and serve thousands of users. 
I am currently researching and writing on Homomorphic Encryption
 
My mission is to leave the world a better place than I found it. And who knows, maybe with your help, we can change the world one line of code at a time.

I strongly feel "The Office" is the best thing that ever graced Television.

I am huge fan of Football, Forca Barca ✌️😎
