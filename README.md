### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Leo! You could say I've had a few different career paths - from saving lives as a medic to building them as a business development manager, and now, coding my way to a better future as a full stack developer. But one thing's remained constant: my mission to leave the world a better place than I found it. And who knows, maybe with your help, we can change the world one line of code at a time.
